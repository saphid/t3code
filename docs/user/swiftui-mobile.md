# SwiftUI mobile

The native SwiftUI app connects to one or more T3 Code computers. Each server owns the settled
state of its threads. Change automatic settlement in an environment's connection details.
These user preferences also apply to other connected environments that support them. Offline
environments keep their existing settings. Open **Preferences** in connection details to see
differences and apply one environment's preferences to the others.

Use **Refresh models** in the model picker for a new or existing task to reload models for the
selected computer. Other connected computers are not refreshed.

Star a model to keep it in **Favorites**, including legacy models. Removing a star from a legacy
model returns it to **Legacy models**.

## Providers and skills

Open **Settings > Providers**, or **Providers** in the model picker, to manage a provider on its
computer. Supported providers offer runtime installation and sign-in. Antigravity can be enabled
here. Runtime files and credentials stay on that computer. API keys and enterprise authentication
settings must be configured on the computer.

The composer uses the skills and slash commands for the selected project or worktree. Skills that
require direct user invocation insert a slash command. Agent-only skills do not appear in the slash
menu.

## Icons and usage

Project icons set on the computer appear in the inbox. Environment icons follow each computer's
settings. Supported environments offer an icon picker in their connection preferences.

Usage loads each computer separately. A slow or offline computer does not prevent the others
from reporting. Use **Refresh prices** to fetch new model rates without waiting for the daily refresh.

Open **Usage > Limits** for subscription limits and reset times reported by your computers.
Supported Codex accounts also let you use a reset credit after confirmation. This uses a credit
on that account and cannot be undone. Computers that do not support limits can still report usage.

Older computers that report daily totals cannot supply the 24-hour view. Select 7d or 30d to
include their data.

## Thread connection state

Cached messages stay readable while a thread catches up. A status above the composer shows when
the content is incomplete or the computer cannot be reached. Use **Retry** if an update fails.
Working indicators return after the thread is current. File previews can finish loading after
the text is ready. Saved drafts load without waiting for the thread to catch up.

## Attachments and sharing

One message can contain up to eight photos, videos, or files. Images can be up to 10 MB. Other
files can be up to 50 MB, or the lower limit reported by the connected server. Older servers accept
images only.

You can also paste an image from the message field's edit menu or drag an image onto the composer.

Attachments start uploading while you compose. **Preparing** means the attachment is waiting to
start. Failed or timed-out uploads show **Retry** and keep the local copy. If the app cannot save
the draft, it shows that error instead of reporting an upload in progress. Tap an image, PDF,
video, or other file to preview it with native controls when iOS supports that format.

Links to images, videos, PDFs and HTML files can also open files outside the workspace when the
server supports them. Failed previews show an error and a retry action.

You can share text, links, photos, videos, and files from another app into T3 Code. Choose a project
to add the shared content to a new-task draft. The share extension never sends the draft.

## Voice input

On supported devices with iOS 26 or later, the composer can transcribe up to five minutes of audio
on the device. Voice input needs microphone permission. The first use can also require Apple's
speech model download.

Tap Stop to finish recording. T3 Code inserts editable text into the draft and never
sends it automatically.

Starting voice input keeps an open keyboard in place. Editing pauses until voice input finishes
or is canceled.

## Codex content

Codex file citations open the cited file when available. Artifact templates include a
**Use** action. **Use** inserts an editable prompt into the composer. Review or change it before
you send it.

## Stopping a turn

Tap **Stop** to request cancellation. **Stopping…** remains visible while the app waits for the
thread to confirm its outcome, including after closing and reopening the thread. Repeated taps
will not send duplicate requests. Acceptance of the request does not mean the agent has finished.

If the connection fails or the app cannot confirm the outcome, it shows **Stop unconfirmed**.
**Retry stop** checks the computer’s current thread status before sending another request. Some
background work does not report a turn outcome, so its stop may remain unconfirmed.

The thread header shows the last update received on this device, with a local date and time.
Connection status appears separately: **Connected** does not mean a new message has arrived.
The receipt time stays unchanged while the thread is quiet. Refreshing cached content does not
create a new receipt.
A received thread snapshot is labeled separately from a new update.

## Tool activity

Consecutive tool calls and updates share one compact, expandable group. Tap the group to
read its calls and details. Text, notices and a new turn start a separate group; later tool
updates stay below intervening text. The age on the right uses the group’s most recent
event, such as **just now**, **20s ago** or **2m ago**, and advances while visible.
