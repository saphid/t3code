# Appearance and themes

On web and desktop, open **Settings → Appearance** to choose a theme and follow the system
appearance or stay in light or dark mode. To use different themes for light and dark mode, select
the corresponding preview within each theme. Appearance preferences are saved separately on each
device or browser.

On web and desktop, use **Change theme** in the command palette to select a theme without leaving chat.
Press **Cmd+Option+A** on macOS or **Ctrl+Alt+A** on Windows/Linux to open the theme picker directly.
Use **Change appearance** in the command palette to choose System, Light, or Dark independently of
the theme. **Cmd+Option+Shift+A** on macOS or **Ctrl+Alt+Shift+A** on Windows/Linux cycles through
those modes. Customize these shortcuts under **Settings → Keybindings**.

On mobile, open **Settings → Appearance**. Mobile has its own themes and text,
code, and terminal preferences. It does not follow environment themes or defaults.

On Android 12 or newer, choose the **Material You** theme in Appearance to use colors from
your wallpaper. Selecting another theme replaces those colors. Like other themes, Material You
can be selected separately for light and dark appearances.
Android uses **Material You Layout** by default unless you have turned it off in Appearance.
It changes shapes, spacing, and controls independently
of the selected theme.

## Customize the interface

On web and desktop, choose **Customize interface** at the bottom of the sidebar, in the command
palette, or under **Settings → Appearance**. Pick a layout to start from: **Balanced**, **Minimal**,
**Focus**, or **Detailed**. Hover or keyboard-focus a layout to preview it on the real interface. Leaving the card or
pressing Escape ends the preview; click to keep it. The same panel changes the theme, light or
dark mode, background scene and transparency, text size, and chat width.

To fine-tune, choose **Thread rows**, **Header**, or **Composer**. That part of the app stays lit
while you edit it in place: drag an item to move it, or use its minus button to hide it. Hidden
items wait beside it, ready to bring back. With the keyboard, Tab to an item, use the arrow keys to
move it, and press Delete to hide it. For the composer, hold it **Expanded** or **Collapsed** to
arrange both layouts.

Changes apply immediately. **Undo** (⌘Z or Ctrl+Z) steps back one change, **Revert** returns to how
things looked when you started, and **Done** or Escape keeps your changes. The arrangement is saved
on each device or browser. Mobile does not have this mode.

## Background scenes

On web and desktop, choose a **Background scene** under **Settings → Appearance** or in **Customize interface** to show a dimmed
scenic backdrop behind the interface. **Theme scene** follows the active theme, so each built-in
theme ships with its own matching scene, and a library of standalone scenes (Alpine, Aurora,
Coastline, Dune, Fjord, Forest Lake, Highlands, Meadow, Nightfall, Terraces) works with any theme.
A picked scene keeps it across theme changes.
Scenes are off (**None**) until you pick one. **Background transparency** controls how much of the
scene shows through the interface, from solid up to fully transparent glass. The backdrop is a
device-local appearance preference.

## Motion

The main sidebar, right panel, and terminal drawer open and close immediately by default. Move the
**Panel animations** slider above 0 ms to add motion, up to 400 ms, unless reduced motion is enabled
in your operating system. Moving between threads always snaps to the selected thread's panel state
without replaying its transitions.

## Custom themes

On web and desktop, choose **Create theme** to adjust a palette, or import a T3 Code or VS Code
theme. The theme editor's color picker lets you select an area of the app to find the color to
change. Export your theme as JSON to share it.

## Environment themes

Environment themes and defaults come from the server serving your web app or the desktop app's
main local environment. app.t3.codes and additional connections do not use them.

Select a published theme in **Settings → Appearance** to follow its palette as the server updates
it. **Duplicate** makes an independent copy you can edit. A saved custom theme with the same ID
takes precedence. If the server stops publishing the selected theme, T3 Code falls back to its
standard theme.

Run this on the server to set a default and switch connected clients to it:

```bash
t3 theme set nightfall
```

Clients that are offline apply it when they reconnect. Each client applies the setting once;
choosing another theme afterward sticks until the next `t3 theme set`. Run the command again to
reapply it, even if the name is unchanged.

`t3 theme clear` removes the default without changing anyone's current theme. `t3 theme show` lists
the default and published themes.

### Publish a theme

Save a theme exported from T3 Code into `~/.t3/userdata/themes/` on the server, or the `themes`
directory under your custom state directory. The filename supplies the theme ID: `nightfall.json`
can be selected with `t3 theme set nightfall`. Keep the filename stable when updating its colors.
Do not use `system`, `light`, `dark`, or a built-in theme's ID.

For an integration that generates a palette, this shorter format also works:

```json
{
  "name": "Nightfall",
  "appearance": "dark",
  "canvas": "#1a1b26",
  "accent": "#7aa2f7",
  "colors": {
    "terminalSelection": "#292e42",
    "error": "#f7768e"
  }
}
```

Set `appearance` to `light` or `dark` and supply hex colors for `canvas` and `accent`. T3 Code
generates the rest. The optional `colors` overrides use the names in the theme editor's advanced
view.

Write updates to a temporary file and rename it into place so clients never read a partial theme.
Invalid files are not published.
