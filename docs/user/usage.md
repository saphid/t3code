# Review usage

The Usage page combines Codex, Claude Code, and Grok Build activity from your connected
environments. It reads the providers' local session history and shows API-equivalent token cost,
processed tokens, cache savings, provider shares, and model breakdowns. Subscription billing is
separate from the raw token cost shown here.

Grok Build totals come from persisted session updates. Interactive turns that never wrote a
completed-turn record will not appear.

Use **Past 24h** for an hourly chart covering the exact rolling 24-hour period. The **7 days**,
**30 days**, and **90 days** ranges use daily resolution. Cost and token toggles update both the
headline and chart. Refreshing rescans every connected environment and refetches model pricing on
each of them, so a newly released model that showed $0.00 gets a price without waiting for the daily
pricing update.

The page warns when the latest calendar day's usage crosses the built-in budget levels. Claude
warnings use its API-rate estimate. API-equivalent warnings include subscription traffic such as
Codex. The warning level starts at $500 of Claude usage or $1,000 API-equivalent. Approval starts at
$1,000 or $1,500. The pause level is $2,000 for either measure.

T3 also applies two hard limits before it sends a new turn to any provider:

- A thread cannot continue after its latest reported context usage reaches the configured token
  limit, which defaults to 250,000 tokens and can be changed in General settings. Start a new thread
  instead of paying to resend the same long conversation. When this happens, the chat shows a
  warning with a **Handover to new thread** button. The button uses GPT
  5.6 Luna with high reasoning to summarize the thread, opens a new draft in the same checkout, and
  places the handover in its composer. It does not start the new thread, so you can choose its model
  and reasoning level before sending.
- At most eight top-level provider turns can run at once across T3. Ready, idle sessions do not
  count. Wait for a running turn to finish or interrupt it before starting another.

These limits cover work T3 launches directly for every provider and client. A provider CLI creates
its own internal subagents, so T3 cannot reject those before the provider starts them. Use the
agent-instruction fan-out limits and the independent usage watcher for that layer.
