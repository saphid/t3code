# Review usage

The Usage page combines Codex, Claude Code, and Grok Build activity from your connected
environments. It reads the providers' local session history and shows API-equivalent token cost,
processed tokens, cache savings, provider shares, and model breakdowns. Subscription billing is
separate from the raw token cost shown here.

Grok Build totals come from persisted session updates. Interactive turns that never wrote a
completed-turn record will not appear.

Use **Past 24h** for an hourly chart covering the exact rolling 24-hour period. The **7 days**,
**30 days**, and **90 days** ranges use daily resolution. Cost and token toggles update both the
headline and chart, and refreshing rescans every connected environment.

Any daily chart zooms: drag across it to make the selection the new date window, and double-click
to return to the preset. The date fields beside the presets accept any custom range directly.

The **Context re-chunking** total is what cache writes cost at the model's cache-write rate: the
price of re-priming a session's context after its cache expired. It only applies to providers that
bill cache writes (Anthropic does, OpenAI does not), so rows without cache writes show a dash.

The breakdown's **Thread** view drills into where the spend went: sessions group into the T3 Code
thread they belong to, with sessions that never ran through T3 Code listed under the first thing
you asked in them. Expanding a row shows a daily cost chart split into cache writes, cache reads,
and fresh input plus output, along with any Claude subagents the thread spawned and their share.
The view names the 40 highest-cost rows and groups lower-cost rows under **Other threads** by
provider and project. Those grouped rows stay in the totals, so the thread view still adds up to
the selected project or full summary.
Rows that map to a thread carry a link that opens it.

Usage is attributed to the project whose folder a session ran in, including sessions driven
outside T3 Code. The breakdown's **Project** view ranks projects by spend, and the project picker
narrows the whole page to one project; work that ran outside every project is grouped under
"Outside projects". Grok Build sessions record no folder and always count there.
