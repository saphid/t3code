 * An entry module exports `activate(context)` and optionally `deactivate()`:
 *
 * ```js
 * export function activate(context) {
 *   context.log.info(`started ${context.plugin.id}`);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `activate` runs once per child process, the first time the server needs the
 * plugin. `context.signal` aborts when the plugin is disabled or the server
 * stops; `deactivate` then gets a short grace period before the process is
 * killed. Members under `context.proposed` exist only when the manifest sets
 * `proposedApi: true` and may change without an API version bump.
