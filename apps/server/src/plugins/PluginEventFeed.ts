/**
 * Delivers the curated event projection (contracts `PluginEvent`) to every
 * enabled plugin that declares the `events` capability.
 *
 * Each such installation has a durable cursor: the event log sequence it has
 * acknowledged through. Its worker reads the log after the cursor in bounded
 * windows and pages, calls the plugin's `t3.events` handler through the
 * catalogue, and moves the cursor past a page only after the plugin answered
 * it. A failed page is retried with backoff and, after `maxFailures`
 * consecutive failures, the worker is quarantined with the cursor unchanged
 * until `plugins.resume`, a re-enable, or a server restart. Delivery is
 * at-least-once. Each worker reports its state through `PluginEventDelivery`,
 * which the catalogue shows as the installation's `eventDelivery`.
 *
 * The cursor starts at the end of the log when an installation is first
 * enabled (the catalogue records it with the enable, through
 * `PluginEventDelivery`), so a new plugin sees exactly the later events. It
 * belongs to the installation: disable and re-enable, consent to changed
 * bytes, and restarts continue from it; remove forgets it. Workers never
 * subscribe to raw events: a commit of a projected event type only wakes
 * them, and they read the store.
