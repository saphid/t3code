/**
 * Offers pending provider approvals to the enabled plugins that declare the
 * `approvals` capability, and records the first answer through the
 * orchestrator.
 *
 * It watches committed runtime requests and approval cards. Once a pending,
 * live approval of a kind some plugin declares and its card, with the prompt,
 * are both committed, it calls each such plugin's `t3.approval.decide` handler
 * at once, each with its own deadline. Providers commit the two in either
 * order; a request whose card never arrives, or has no prompt, is left to the
 * user. An approve
 * or deny becomes a `runtime-request.plugin-respond` command, which the
 * orchestrator accepts only while the request is still pending, so the first
 * answer recorded wins, whether it came from the user or a plugin. Abstaining,
 * an invalid answer, a failure, the deadline, and disabling the plugin all
 * leave the request to the user. When the request stops being pending, calls
 * still running are cancelled.
 *
 * Plugins decide on the whole request or not at all: when its prompt or subject
 * is longer than a plugin may receive, no plugin is asked. Work is bounded: at
 * most `maxActiveOffers` requests are being offered and `maxActiveCalls` plugin
 * calls are running at once; past either limit the request, or that plugin's
 * call, is left to the user at once rather than queued.
 *
 * Only requests committed while this service runs are offered: after a
 * restart, an older pending request waits for the user. Plugin work never runs
 * on EventSink's commit path; the subscription is bounded and resumes from the
 * last event it saw when it falls behind.
