/**
 * Digest of a plugin directory's exact bytes, which consent binds to.
 *
 * Every regular file under the directory counts, by relative path and
 * content, so an edit, addition, removal, or rename changes the digest. The
 * only exceptions are `.git` directories and `.DS_Store` files, which tools
 * rewrite on their own and Node never loads as modules. Symbolic links,
 * special files, and trees past the limits are refused rather than skipped: a
 * digest that silently left something out would not describe what runs.
 *
 * The directory stays writable by its owner, so a digest describes the bytes
 * at the moment it was taken. Code the plugin loads from outside its
 * directory is not covered.
