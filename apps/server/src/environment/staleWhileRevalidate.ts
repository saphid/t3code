/**
 * Memoizes a discovery that is cheap when warm and slow on a loaded host, for
 * callers that sit on the client connect path. The first call computes inline.
 * After that every call returns the last good value immediately; once the
 * value is older than `ttl`, one detached refresh replaces it in the background.
 *
 * Only successful results are stored, so a caller interrupted mid-scan (a
 * client disconnecting, a timeout around the call) leaves the cache untouched
 * instead of replaying the interrupt to later callers. Expiry uses the
 * monotonic clock so a wall-clock adjustment cannot keep a stale entry alive.
 *
 * Refreshes run in the scope that built the cache, so they are interrupted
 * (and any scoped probe process cleaned up) when the server shuts down, and
 * each is capped at `REFRESH_TIMEOUT` so a probe hung on an unresponsive mount
 * cannot leave the entry stale forever.
