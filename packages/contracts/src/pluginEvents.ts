/**
 * PluginEvents - The curated event projection delivered to plugins that
 * declare the `events` capability.
 *
 * The server reads its durable event log for each such plugin from a
 * persisted, per-installation cursor and hands the plugin small, ordered
 * pages. A page is acknowledged only when the plugin's handlers return for
 * every event in it; the cursor then moves past the page. Delivery is
 * at-least-once: a crash or failure after a side effect and before the
 * acknowledgement delivers the same events again, so handlers deduplicate by
 * `deliveryId`.
 *
 * The projection carries identifiers, outcomes and the thread title, never
 * message bodies. New event types and new optional fields are additive:
 * handlers must ignore types they do not know.
 *
