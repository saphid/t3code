/**
 * PluginApprovals - Lets a plugin answer the approvals a provider asks for.
 *
 * A plugin declares the `approvals` capability (with `proposedApi: true`) and
 * the request kinds it wants in its manifest, and registers one handler:
 *
 * ```js
 * export function activate(context) {
 *   context.proposed.handle("t3.approval.decide", ({ kind, subject }) =>
 *     kind === "command" && subject?.startsWith("git status")
 *       ? { decision: "approve", reason: "Read-only git command." }
 *       : { decision: "abstain" },
 *   );
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When a provider asks to approve a request of a declared kind, the server
 * calls the handler of every enabled plugin that declares it, all at once. The
 * user can answer the request in the app at any time. The first answer the
 * server records wins, whether it came from the user or a plugin; later
 * answers change nothing, and plugins still deciding are cancelled.
 *
 * `abstain`, `null`, an invalid answer, a failure, a crash, the deadline, and
 * disabling the plugin all leave the request pending for the user. A plugin
 * never approves anything by failing. Approvals only exist when a provider
 * asks for them: a thread in full-access mode asks for none.
 *
